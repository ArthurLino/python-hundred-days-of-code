<p align="center">I've been coding with Dr. Angela Yu during her course which named this this repo.</p>
<p align="center">For the next days, this will be my main challenge.</p>
<p align="center">Obs: the very first days were introducing python basics, the challenge actually started at day fifteen. The very last days projects are also going to have their own repos.</p>
